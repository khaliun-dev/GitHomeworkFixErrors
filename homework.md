# Linus's Homework


## 1. What is 2 + 2?


4


## 2. What is JavaScript?


It's a programming language for webdev, among other things, that runs alongside HTML and CSS.


## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?


1: Allows collaborations of multiple devs, on same projects, by hosting centralised online repositories, therefore avoiding the problem of localisation.


2: Helps keep track of individual commits and mergers to the main backlog, in a systemic way, which avoids the problem of corrupting original codes, due to errors etc.


3: They are stil keeping the spirit of "open source" alive, allowing people to share new code and solutions, rather than having everything behind paywalls.


## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?


Forking lets me make a copy of the original repo, so I could work on it independently, on my own Github profile, for example.


## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?


Cloning lets me create a local copy of a repo, on my PC.



## 6. What is a Pull Request?


PR is me asking for permission to merge what i have been working on independently to the main code.
